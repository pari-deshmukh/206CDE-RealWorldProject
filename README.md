# 206CDE - Real World Project

Project Repository for Autonomous Land Vehicle's Movement Controller method.

# Project Abstract

The project aims to build an autonomous vehicle by using the hardware and software to manage all functional aspects of an autonomous vehicle that is capable of traversing an unknown track without human input via Raspberry Pi Zero W. A camera is used to provide necessary data from the real world to the vehicle. The vehicle is capable of reaching the given destination safely and intelligently thus avoiding the risk of human errors / obstacles. In addition to this, we designed the circuit and did the engineering related work on the vehicle. The software was implemented by developing individual functionality as modules using Python and Python based libraries like RPi.GPIO for critical components such as the autonomous movement controller. Raspberry Pi is used as the primary controller hardware, being the central processor for the Autonomous vehicle. Many algorithms like obstacle detection, track detection along with backtrack and explore mechanisms are combined together to provide the necessary control to the vehicle.

# Introduction:
When we begin to think about the question of what exactly it is that can allow a vehicle to behave
autonomously, we begin to realize that even under the cover of advanced algorithms exist conceptually
simple components to make such a thing possible. Our idea from the start was to develop a Raspberry Pi
based tracked autonomous or self-driving vehicle with a camera unit mounted to the top, which has the
capability to learn its path and environment to achieve the set goals.

# Purpose:
An autonomous or self-driving vehicle is essentially one that must be able to navigate by itself, without
human input to a pre-established destination over a given track. The vehicle should be able to make its own
driving decisions, able to cope with all situations and continuously keep learning from its environment and
decisions on that environment to maximize its output over time.
